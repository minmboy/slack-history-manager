# Slack History Manager

[![Deploy](https://github.com/minmboy/slack-history-manager/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/minmboy/slack-history-manager/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)

Manage your own Slack history: review what you have posted, then delete the messages — and optionally the
files you attached — that you want gone. It can also export the workspace member directory, with emails and
phone numbers, as CSV or JSON. **There is no backend.** It builds to static files and talks to
Slack directly from your browser.

### → [minmboy.github.io/slack-history-manager](https://minmboy.github.io/slack-history-manager/)

Or run it yourself, which is the stronger option for a tool you hand a token to:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # dist/ deploys to any static host
```

Available in English and Korean — switcher in the top right.

Before pasting a token into any copy of this tool — the hosted one included — read
[Verifying this tool yourself](#verifying-this-tool-yourself). It takes about a minute.

## Why a frontend-only app is possible

Slack's Web API returns `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so a browser can call it directly.
Two constraints shaped everything else.

**1. You cannot use the `Authorization` header.**
Slack's `access-control-allow-headers` does not include `authorization`, so sending the token as a
header gets the request rejected at the CORS preflight. This app puts the token in a
**form-urlencoded body** instead. Passing `URLSearchParams` as `body` makes fetch set
`content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which is a CORS-safelisted value — so no preflight
is ever issued. See [`src/lib/slack.ts`](src/lib/slack.ts).

**2. You cannot use OAuth.**
`oauth.v2.access` requires a `client_secret`, which cannot live in frontend code. So instead of an
OAuth flow, **you create an app in your own workspace and paste its User Token**. That is not a
compromise — see the next section.

---

## Rate limits: why this shape is the only one that works

Since May 29, 2025, Slack limits `conversations.history` and `conversations.replies` to
**one request per minute, 15 objects maximum** for commercially distributed apps that are not approved
for the Slack Marketplace. Under that limit, scanning thousands of messages is not practical.

> Marketplace-approved apps and **internal customer-built apps are not affected.**
> — [Slack changelog](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2025-05-terms-rate-limit-update-and-faq)

An app you build and install only in your own workspace falls squarely in that exemption, so it keeps
**Tier 3 (50/min)**. Enabling Distribution on the app would put you back under the strict limit, so
**keep the app private.**

The client paces requests per method (Slack meters per method, per workspace) and, on a 429, waits out
the `Retry-After` header — which Slack does expose to JavaScript via `access-control-expose-headers`.
If responses start coming back 15 at a time, the app flags it as the throttled case.

Deletion runs at about one message a second — Slack's own design guidance — and widens the gap for the rest
of the session the first time Slack answers 429. Sending in parallel would not help: the budget is per
method, per workspace, per app, so concurrent requests only reach the wall sooner. A 2,000-message run
takes a little over half an hour, and the app is built to survive that:

- The waits between requests run in a Web Worker ([`src/lib/timer.ts`](src/lib/timer.ts)). Chrome checks
  the timers of a tab hidden for more than five minutes only once a minute, which would turn one message a
  second into one a minute the moment you switched tabs; worker timers are not throttled that way.
- The screen is kept awake while a run is in flight, where the browser supports the Wake Lock API.
- A run can be paused and resumed. Resuming picks up exactly the messages no run has reached yet.
- If a run stops anyway — the tab closed, the computer slept — scanning the same conversations again finds
  only what is left, and the picker's history shows where you got to.

---

## How it works

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Connect | Copy the app manifest → create and install the app → paste the `xoxp-` User Token → `auth.test` |
| Pick conversations | `conversations.list` plus `users.list` (names resolve in the background). Optional start date narrows the scan |
| Scan | `conversations.history`, then `conversations.replies` for every message with `reply_count > 0`. Keeps only messages where `user` matches your own ID |
| Review | A checkbox per message, windowed so a scan of any size scrolls normally. Filter by date, keyword, thread, or attachment; select or clear whole conversations. Export the staged list as CSV or JSON — a backup taken before anything is deleted |
| Export members | Optional, on the picker screen. `users.list` walked to the end, then CSV or JSON: ID, handle, display and real name, email, phone, title, bot / deactivated / guest / admin flags, time zone. Deactivated accounts and apps are left out unless you tick the box |
| Delete | Type the confirmation word → `chat.delete`, one call per message, then `files.delete` for attachments if you opted in. Progress, per-item failure reasons, and an export carrying the text of every message removed |

**Thread replies are deleted before their roots.** Deleting a root first leaves its replies stranded
under a "message deleted" placeholder.

## Verifying this tool yourself

The repository is public so you can check it rather than take anyone's word for it. Before pasting a
token, look at the following.

**1. There are only two dependencies.** The `dependencies` in [`package.json`](package.json) are
`react` and `react-dom`. No external CDN scripts, no analytics, no web fonts. The i18n layer is
hand-rolled for the same reason — adding a translation library would widen the surface you have to audit.

**2. There is exactly one place a network request leaves from.**

```bash
grep -rn "fetch(\|XMLHttpRequest\|WebSocket\|sendBeacon" src/
```

One hit: `fetch(API_BASE + method, ...)` in [`src/lib/slack.ts`](src/lib/slack.ts). `API_BASE` is
pinned to `https://slack.com/api/` at the top of the same file.

**3. Storage is limited to three keys.**

```bash
grep -rn "localStorage\|sessionStorage\|indexedDB\|document.cookie" src/
grep -rn "pushState\|replaceState\|location.hash" src/
```

- `sessionStorage` in [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx) holds the token, and only if you tick
  "Remember in this tab only". It is gone when the tab closes.
- `localStorage` in [`src/i18n/`](src/i18n/) holds the language choice — `ko` or `en`, nothing else.
- `localStorage` in [`src/lib/history.ts`](src/lib/history.ts) holds the history the picker shows beside each
  conversation: per workspace and user, a conversation's ID, when it was last scanned and how many of your
  messages that found, and when messages were last deleted from it and how many in total. No names and no
  message text. **Clear history** in the picker removes it.
- The remaining hits are the checkbox label in the translation files.

- The URL is the fourth surface, and it is deliberately thin: the hash carries the current step and the
  conversation *types* you ticked, nothing else. Never the token, never message text, never which
  conversations you selected, never your review filters. A fragment is not sent to the server either, so
  none of it reaches GitHub's request logs.

No IndexedDB, no cookies. **Message contents are never persisted by the app** — scan results live in memory
and disappear on reload, and so does a loaded member directory. The one way either leaves the browser is an
export you click, which writes a file to your own disk; each screen says so next to the button.

**4. The browser enforces all of the above.** The policy is defined once in
[`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) and applied to the built page two ways — as a `<meta http-equiv>`
tag inside `index.html`, and as a generated `_headers` file for hosts that turn it into real response
headers:

```
default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src https://slack.com; ...
```

Because `connect-src` lists only `slack.com`, **a tampered build still could not send your token
anywhere else.** The browser refuses the connection. Check a live deployment either way:

```bash
# the meta tag, which every host preserves
curl -s https://minmboy.github.io/slack-history-manager/ | grep -o 'http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"[^>]*'

# the response header, on hosts that can set one (GitHub Pages cannot, so this is empty there)
curl -sD - -o /dev/null https://minmboy.github.io/slack-history-manager/ | grep -i content-security-policy
```

**5. You can watch it at runtime.** Keep the DevTools Network tab open and confirm that nothing but
`slack.com/api/*` is ever requested.

> Building it yourself is the strongest option. If you use a deployed copy, **verify the URL** — a
> lookalike domain harvesting tokens is the obvious attack on a tool like this.

## Safety rails

- Only messages where `message.user` equals the `user_id` from `auth.test` are ever collected.
  `chat.delete` is the final authority on what may actually be removed.
- **Dry run** walks the whole queue and reports targets and ordering without deleting anything.
- **Pause** is always one click away during a run, and **Resume** continues with only what is left. A
  request cut off mid-flight may already have reached Slack; resuming then gets `message_not_found`, recorded
  as already gone, so nothing is deleted twice.
- **File deletion is off by default.** It runs as a second phase, after the messages, and only when you
  tick the box — with the "removes it everywhere it was shared" warning next to it.
- The delete button stays disabled until you type the confirmation word.
- CSV cells that begin with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` or a control character get a leading `'`, so a spreadsheet
  shows a message such as `=HYPERLINK(…)` instead of evaluating it. JSON exports carry text byte-for-byte.
- The token lives in memory, optionally in `sessionStorage`. **Revoke token** calls `auth.revoke`.
- `invalid_auth`, `token_revoked` and `missing_scope` abort the run; every other per-message failure is
  recorded and the run continues.

## Member contact export

The picker screen has a second panel that exports the workspace member directory. It is separate from the
cleanup flow and changes nothing in Slack — it only reads `users.list`.

- **Email needs `users:read.email`**, which the manifest above includes. Without it Slack does not fail the
  call; it just leaves every email out. The panel notices when no member came back with one and says so.
  If you added the scope to an existing app, reinstall it so the token picks it up.
- **Phone and title come from the profile.** They are there only where a member filled them in, so a column
  that is mostly empty is normal. No extra scope is needed.
- **Guests and admins are flagged, not filtered.** Deactivated accounts and apps (Slackbot included) are
  excluded by default, because a contact list rarely wants them; a checkbox brings them back.
- In the CSV, a phone number that starts with `+` gets the same leading `'` as any other formula-like cell,
  so a spreadsheet shows it as text rather than evaluating it. The JSON carries it as entered.
- **This is other people's personal data.** The file is written only to your disk, but what you may do with
  it is up to your company's policy, not this tool.

## Limits (know these)

- **Deletion cannot be undone.**
- If a workspace admin has disabled message deletion, calls fail with `cant_delete_message`.
  This tool records that rather than working around it.
- This is the same action as deleting in the Slack UI. Records **may survive in your company's export,
  Discovery, or retention backups.**
- **Attachments are opt-in, and deleting one is wider than it looks.** `chat.delete` only removes the
  message; the file is a separate object, so the run calls `files.delete` as a second phase and only if
  you tick the box on the confirm screen. **A file does not belong to a conversation** — deleting it
  removes it from every conversation it was ever shared into, including ones you did not select here.
  Only files you uploaded are offered; a file you merely re-shared belongs to its uploader.
  Requires the `files:write` scope.
- **Leaving attachments in place is not the same as them surviving forever.** Where a workspace aligns
  file retention to message retention, Slack ["will keep all files until any messages that shared them
  are deleted"](https://slack.com/help/articles/203457187-Customize-data-retention-in-Slack), after
  which files with no shares get a 30-day grace period and are then permanently deleted. Where it is not
  aligned, the file stays — listed under your Files and reachable by its permalink to anyone who already
  had access. You cannot see which applies to your workspace, which is why the option exists.
- **Private channels and group DMs you have left are unreachable.** You are no longer a member, so they
  are neither listed nor readable. Rejoin to clean one up, or accept that those messages stay.
- Setting a scan start date filters `conversations.history` by *root* timestamp, so replies you wrote
  inside a thread that started before the cutoff are not found. Leave the date empty for a complete
  sweep.
- You cannot delete anyone else's messages. Deleting your own thread root leaves other people's
  replies in place.

## Deployment

The output is static and routing is hash-based, so no rewrite rules are needed anywhere.
The build carries its own CSP in a meta tag, so the policy survives on hosts that cannot set headers.

**Cloudflare Pages / Netlify** — they pick up the generated `dist/_headers` automatically, so the
policy arrives as real response headers as well as the meta tag. This is the strongest option.

```
Build command:  npm run build
Build output:   dist
```

**GitHub Pages** — where this repository publishes, via
[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml). Every push to `main` lints,
builds and deploys. In a fork, enable it once under Settings → Pages → Source → "GitHub Actions"; the
workflow is inert until then. It sets `BASE_PATH` from the repository name, because a project site is
served from `/<repo>/` rather than the domain root.

GitHub Pages cannot set response headers, so the CSP arrives only via the meta tag. That still enforces
`connect-src`, which is the directive that matters here — confirmed against the live deployment: a
request to `slack.com` succeeds and a request to any other host is refused. What you give up is
`frame-ancestors`, which is ignored inside a meta tag, plus the supplementary headers
(`Referrer-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and so on).

**Vercel** — move the directives from `vite.config.ts` into `vercel.json` to get them as headers too.

For a one-time cleanup, not deploying at all and running `npm run dev` locally is the safest option.

## Navigation

Each step is a route, so Back works and a link describes a view:
`#/select?kinds=im,mpim`, `#/review`, `#/run`.

Hash routing rather than the History API, for the same reason the CSP is a meta tag: this is served from a
GitHub Pages subpath with no rewrite rules, so `/review` would 404 on refresh.

Because scan results are memory-only, some routes cannot be restored. Opening `#/review` cold does not show
an empty list implying there is nothing to delete — it drops you back to the picker and says why. A delete
run pins the route while it is in flight; navigating away cannot orphan it. Once a real run has started,
Back does not reopen its review list — those messages are gone, and confirming the same list again would
overwrite the record of the run — so it leads out to the conversation picker instead. A dry run deletes
nothing, so after one, Back returns to the list. From any screen, the title in the top-left corner leads
back to the picker. Leaving the run screen keeps its results until a new scan replaces them, and the picker
links back to them in the meantime.

## Layout

```
src/lib/slack.ts    CORS-shaped fetch, per-method adaptive rate limiting, 429 retry, cursor pagination
src/lib/timer.ts    Sleep backed by a Web Worker, so background tabs keep their pace
src/lib/api.ts      Typed wrappers: auth.test, conversations.list, users.list (names, and the full member export), users.info, files.delete
src/lib/scan.ts     Walks history + replies, collects your own messages
src/lib/deleter.ts  Delete queue: messages (replies before roots, newest first), then files; per-failure classification
src/lib/export.ts   CSV and JSON for the staged list, the run results and the member directory; joins message text onto results
src/components/MemberExport.tsx  Loads the member directory on request and offers it as CSV or JSON
src/components/MessageList.tsx  Windowed list — fixed inline row heights, prefix-sum offsets, binary-searched window
src/lib/router.ts   Hash subscription and writes; announces its own pushState/replaceState
src/lib/route.ts    Pure URL <-> view state, plus the clamp that refuses unrestorable routes
src/i18n/           Hand-rolled translations; ko.tsx defines the type every other language must match
src/App.tsx         Screen wiring: derives the step from the route, runs the scan and the delete queue
vite.config.ts      The CSP, written once and emitted as both a meta tag and a _headers file
```
