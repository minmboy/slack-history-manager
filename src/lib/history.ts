/**
 * Per-conversation scan and deletion history, kept in this browser.
 *
 * This is the one place the app persists anything about your conversations,
 * so it stores only what the picker needs: for each conversation, its ID, when
 * it was last scanned and how many of your messages that scan found, and when
 * messages were last deleted from it and how many in total. No names — the
 * picker knows them while you are connected — and never any message text.
 *
 * Keyed by workspace and user, so two accounts in one browser never mix.
